# File_tools
GUI rename script and others  
  
Made for windows purposely, also works in linux ( doesn't have much meaning if you are a linux veteran )  
Using "tkinterdnd2" as "drag and drop" function ( already put in the repository ) https://github.com/pmgagne/tkinterdnd2  

## How to use
Using pip install chardet, natsort, crcmod  
run main.py  

## Note
Function in unrar include "subprocess", so part of it won't work well after using pyinstaller
