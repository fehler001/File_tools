Made for windows purposely, also works in linux ( doesn't have much meaning if you are a linux veteran )

using "tkinterdnd2" as "drag and drop" function ( already put in the repository )
https://github.com/pmgagne/tkinterdnd2



How to use:

using pip install chardet, natsort, crcmod

run main.py



Note:

Some function using "subprocess", so part of it won't work well after using pyinstaller
or you can just not use that function
